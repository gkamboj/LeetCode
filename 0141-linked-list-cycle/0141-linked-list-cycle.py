    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

'''
Approach: Take slow and fast pointers starting from head. If they ever meet before fast reaching end, cycle exists.
Read Floyd cycle detection algorithm for more detail.
